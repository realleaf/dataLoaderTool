# dataLoaderTool
These codes help me to process my own data and make self-defined dataset and load it into my deep neural network model.
I have some based code files about data receiver and loader in python used in deep learning neural networks model.
This is a private project, which is not allowed to share to others publicly so that there will exits no common and useful files 
with really significant meaning. Therefore, everybody could save your energy to find easy work here. But anyone who can come up with 
update ideas about current files or find some mistakes in them is welcome to connect with us, and we will be very gradeful about what you
have done.
## dataProcessing.py
this code is used for preprocessing of raw data.
## dataTool.py
this code is used for make dataset and data loader.
